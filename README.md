How to reproduce our results:

1)Run all the TREC Eval primer cells 
2)Run every cells you encounter sequentially 
EXCEPTION: PLM TAKES A HUGE AMOUNT OF TIME: you better not run it 

PS: Once you generated the files, you can sometime restart the kernel to clean the memory otherwise the notebook might lag. 

PS2: we could not run step 3 because it was taking too much memory
